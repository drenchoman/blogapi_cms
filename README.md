## Assignment
> Create an API only backend and two different front-ends. One for accessing and editing blog posts and the other for reading and commenting on blog posts

## Learnings
> Behold the power of an API backend! Being able to update the server from a seperate website / CMS. Decoupling at its finest

> Reminded myself how to build web pages using Vanilla JS, I usually use frameworks (React) when building now so it was useful to brush up my knowledge on this.

> My JS is sloppily written and it is in one big JS file but it works and can update the backend without issue. I am reminded how much I prefer building using React but this may just be because I am more comfortable with it.

## CMS Built using
